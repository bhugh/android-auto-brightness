Is Android's Adaptive Screen Brightness driving you crazy?

Here is a simple replacement app.

It automatically sets display brightness based on ambient light and auto-updates it every few seconds. (You can set the update Interval as long or short as you like.)

It includes a simple slider to manually tweak the auto settings to be a bit brighter or darker.

RUN VIA QUICK SETTINGS
You can pop up the slider to adjust the brightness by placing the app on the home screen OR by using a Quick Settings Tile.

SHAKE SOME SENSE INTO YOUR PHONE
Additionally you can shake your device to re-adjust the brightness - useful in situations where the light level has changed and you can't read the screen.

LITTLE BATTERY USAGE
The project uses little or no noticeable amount of battery.

NOTIFICATIONS - TURN OFF WHEN NOT NEEDED
The project will display notifications and a small toast message every time it changes the brightness level. This is useful when first calibrating the app but quickly becomes annoying. Simply go to the Settings menu and turn notification and/or toast message off when you don't need them.

OTHER SETTINGS
In Settings, you can set min and max brightness values and tweak the overall brightness curve as needed for your device, or turn the whole system on or off.
