Android Auto Brightness - a small app to automatically adjust the Android display brightness. 

Available as s self-standing Android app, or as a Tasker project. 

Is Android's Adaptive Screen Brightness driving you crazy? 

Here is a simple replacement system that runs as a small self standing app or in Tasker. 

It automatically sets display brightness based on ambient light ad auto-updates it every few seconds. 

It includes a simple slider to manually tweak the auto settings to be a bit brighter or darker. 

Can be installed as a Quick Settings Tile (just click the easy auto-install button). 

Normally the project is run via the Quick Settings Tile and/or a Tasker Widget on the home screen set to run task "Display Brightness Slider". 

You can also set up homescreen Tasker widgets to run tasks "Display Brightness Low", "Display Brightness Medium", and "Display Brightness High" for quick access to those settings. 

Additionally you can shake your device to auto-run Display Brightness Medium - useful in situations where the light level has changed and you can't read the screen. 

The project uses little or no noticeable amount of battery. 

The project will display notifications every time it changes the brightness level. This is useful when first calibrating the app but quickly becomes annoying. Simply disable the notifications as soon as you no longer need them.
